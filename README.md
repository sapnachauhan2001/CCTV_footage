# CCTVV_footage


# Data Collection and Preprocessing

## Step 1: Data Collection

### 1.1 Collecting CCTV Footage

To collect a dataset of publicly available CCTV footage capturing people walking, follow these steps:

1. Obtain permission to use the CCTV footage if required.
2. Download or acquire the CCTV footage in video format (e.g., MP4).
3. Create a directory to store the collected frames (e.g., `collected_frames`).
4. Use the `collect_data.py` script to extract individual frames from the video.

   ```bash
   python collect_data.py



# Person Detection and Tracking

## Step 2: Person Detection

### 2.1 Implementing Person Detection

In this step, we implement person detection using a pre-trained object detection model, such as YOLO or Faster R-CNN. The script `person_detection.py` performs the following tasks:

1. Loads the pre-trained YOLOv3 model.
2. Reads the input video frames.
3. Detects persons in each frame using the model.
4. Draws bounding boxes around detected persons and labels them.
5. Displays the output video with detected persons.

To run the person detection script, use the following command:

```bash
python person_detection.py



# Feature Extraction

## Step 3: Feature Extraction

### 3.1 Extracting Relevant Features

In this step, we extract relevant features from the detected and tracked individuals. The choice of feature extraction methods depends on the nature of your dataset and the specific requirements of your application. The script `feature_extraction.py` demonstrates a basic feature extraction method using color histograms as an example.

The following tasks are performed in the script:

1. Loads the input video frames.
2. Performs person detection and tracking (as shown in previous steps).
3. Extracts relevant features (color histograms) from the tracked individuals.
4. Stores the extracted features in a list for further processing or analysis.

To run the feature extraction script, use the following command:

```bash
python feature_extraction.py





# Person Re-Identification Model

## Step 4: Person Re-Identification Model

### 4.1 Model Architecture

In this step, we design and implement a person re-identification model using PyTorch. The model architecture is a critical component of person re-identification systems. For this example, we provide a simplified implementation of a Siamese Network.

The Siamese Network consists of two identical subnetworks, each taking an input feature vector and mapping it to a lower-dimensional space. The network is trained to minimize the contrastive loss between positive and negative pairs.

You can customize the model architecture based on your project's requirements and dataset characteristics.

### 4.2 Training the Model

To train the person re-identification model, follow these steps:

1. Prepare your custom dataset for person re-identification, including features extracted from the previous step.
2. Create data loaders to load the dataset.
3. Initialize the model and optimizer.
4. Define the training loop, including the loss calculation and backpropagation.
5. Save the trained model for later use.

The provided script `train_person_reid_model.py` serves as a template for training your model. Customize it according to your dataset and training requirements.

### 4.3 Model Evaluation

Evaluate the performance of the trained model on person re-identification tasks. Common metrics include Rank-1 Accuracy and Mean Average Precision (mAP). Here's how to evaluate the model:

1. Load the trained model using `torch.load()`.
2. Load your evaluation dataset, including query and gallery sets.
3. Extract features for the query and gallery sets using the trained model.
4. Calculate Rank-1 Accuracy or other relevant metrics based on your evaluation criteria.

The provided script `evaluate_person_reid_model.py` outlines the evaluation process. Adjust it as needed for your specific evaluation requirements.

Please ensure you document the model architecture, training process, and evaluation results in your README file, along with any additional details relevant to your project.



# Visualization and Demonstration

## Step 5: Visualization and Demonstration

### 5.1 Visualizations

Create visualizations to showcase the effectiveness of your person re-identification model. These visualizations can include re-identification results, feature embeddings, and confusion matrices. Use these visualizations to provide insights into the model's performance.

The script `visualize_person_reid.py` serves as a template for generating re-identification results. Customize it to create visualizations based on your dataset and model outputs.

### 5.2 Demonstration

Demonstrate how the model accurately re-identifies individuals across different camera views. You can create a visual demonstration that shows the re-identification process using video footage from multiple camera angles.

The script `demonstrate_person_reid.py` outlines the process for demonstrating person re-identification in a video. Customize it to match your dataset and visualization requirements.

Include relevant context and commentary in your README to guide readers through the visualizations and demonstrations.

Visualizations and demonstrations provide a clear understanding of your model's capabilities and its practical use in real-world scenarios. Ensure that the visualizations are clear and the demonstrations effectively showcase your model's re-identification capabilities.
